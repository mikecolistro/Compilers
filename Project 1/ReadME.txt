This is Michael Colistro's Project one. 
Student numeber is 0488092.
Project works smoothly, only one problem that I was able to find and it was it doesnt
print floating point numbers correctly.
The test file is called "Test.txt".
The finite state diagram is called "stateDiagram.png", this is what I used to design
my transition table.
